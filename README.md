# 3D-Object-Reconstruction-and-Grasp-Pose-Detection-

Implemented an end-to-end framework for 3D object reconstruction and grasp pose detection. Used 3D-R2N2 neural network which takes object images from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction, which is visualized in RVIZ using Point Cloud Library (PCL). Grasp Pose Detection (GPD) framework is then integrated to predict grasp candidates and classify them as good or bad grasp.
